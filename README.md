Neural Networks for Online Advertising: Predicting Post-Click Sales with High Accuracy

Introduction: Digital marketing plays a pivotal role in modern advertising, with businesses leveraging data-driven strategies to enhance user engagement. Click-through rate (CTR) is a key metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of advertisements by measuring the proportion of users who interact with a given ad.
Conventional machine learning methods, like logistic regression and decision trees, have been employed for click-through rate prediction; nevertheless, they frequently inadequately capture intricate interactions among features.  This study aims to examine the effectiveness of deep learning in improving the accuracy of click-through rate predictions.

Dataset: 
A publicly accessible advertising dataset with comprehensive records of digital marketing campaigns served as the study's dataset. It is appropriate for click-through rate (CTR) prediction since it has a number of features pertaining to user interactions, ad performance, and financial indicators.

Model Architecture:
The predictive model is developed as a deep neural network (DNN) utilizing the Keras Sequential API.  The architecture is meticulously crafted to harmonize learning capacity with generalization, guaranteeing resilient predictions for the target variable (`post\_click\_sales\_amount`).  The model has an input layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer, utilizing multiple regularization techniques to improve stability and mitigate overfitting.


 The input layer is configured to correspond with the amount of features in the dataset, ensuring compatibility with the processed input data.  Subsequently, there are three fully linked (dense) hidden layers, comprising 512, 256, and 128 neurons, respectively.  Each layer employs the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, which incorporates non-linearity into the model, facilitating the learning of intricate correlations within the data.
